FastAI is a library, based on pytorch. It was created, to simplify machine learning. It is now forgotten by developers, I think. 

I used it while manualy creating datasets like so:
Steps:
1. I manualy label a small portion of data
2. I split that data in folders
3. I load sutable fastAI model, and train it on labeled data
4. I use model to separate the rest of the data to temporate folders
5. I look through the temporate folders, and confirm labels on the data thats inside

I think it saves a lot of time.
